Snapshots

What is AWS Snapshots?

Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) is a service that provides persistent block-level storage for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. 
Snapshot technology has been integral to protecting data both in the on-prem data center and in the cloud. AWS snapshots come in the form of Amazon Elastic Block Storage snapshots

	-An EBS snapshot is a backup of a single EBS volume
	-An AMI image is a backup of an entire EC2 instance
	-EBS snapshots are the backups of the individual EBS volumes attached to the EC2 instance 
	  at the time the AMI image was created
	-Snapshots are useful for backing up data at different intervals, which allows information to be recovered from different periods of time
	-Many backup programs that create snapshots also allow specific files to be recovered from the snapshot, instead of having to restore the                    	 	 	  complete  backup.


Snapshots can be used to create a backup of critical workloads, such as a large database or a file system that spans across multiple EBS volumes. 

Multi-volume snapshots allow you to take exact point-in-time, data coordinated, and crash-consistent snapshots across multiple EBS volumes attached to an EC2 instance.


One of the very useful features of Amazon EBS is creating snapshots of EBS volumes. According to Amazon Knowledge Base, AWS EBS snapshots are backups of EBS volumes. 


Backup Tools:
	Veritas net backup, 
	emc networker,
	covalt galaxy

We used to take the backups for 
	-EC2 Instances
	-Databases
	-RDS
Using Snapshots we used to take the backups.

EC2-Instance

	-Generally we have two types of volumes
		1.RootVolume  -by default root volume is created when we are launch the instance.
		2. DataVolume -EBS, Instance Store 

1.Launch the EC2 Instance 
	@Step4: Add Storage
		Volume type= root (This is OS in AWS)

		Add Extra Volumes
		click on <Add Volume> 
		  Volumetype=EBS
		   size =2GB
		
		  Volumetype=EBS
		   size=4GB

(Note:we can select the checkbox of 'Delete on Termination', which meants when you terminate the system, it will delete these volumes as well.
	if we are not selecting this, it will delete only EC2-Instance only not volumes. But if we forgot to delete the volumes explicitly,then it will be                charged)

Launch the machine with other defaults.
	No need to provide the PrimaryIP

2. Now, connect to the EC2 instance through SSH
	-Need to format the volumes and create file system, mount
	[root@ip-10-1-1-30 ~]#mkdir /2gbdrive
	[root@ip-10-1-1-30 ~]#mkdir /4gbdrive

	format the volume

	[root@ip-10-1-1-30 ~]#lsblk
	[root@ip-10-1-1-30 ~]#fdisk /dev/xvdb
	[root@ip-10-1-1-30 ~]#fdisk /dev/xvdc
	
	(partitions are ready now, check with command 'lsblk')

3.Create file system
	
	[root@ip-10-1-1-30 ~]#lsblk
	[root@ip-10-1-1-30 ~]#mkfs.ext3 /dev/xvdb1
	[root@ip-10-1-1-30 ~]#mkfs.ext3 /dev/xvdc1

	Mount the volumes
	[root@ip-10-1-1-30 ~]#mount /dev/xvdb1 /2gbdrive/
	[root@ip-10-1-1-30 ~]#mount /dev/xvdc1 /4gbdrive/


InterviewQuestion:
	When I have taken the Snapshot backup but I unable to restore the machine, why?
	Ans: Snapshot backup is taking the backups of individual volumes i.e., explicitly, not total ec2 machine.
                          so we couldn't able to restore the ec2 machine. Root volume cannot be added in snapshot.

4.Add some data into these volumes
	[root@ip-10-1-1-30 ~]#cd /2gbdrive/
	[root@ip-10-1-1-30 2gbdrive~]# mkdir snap1
	[root@ip-10-1-1-30 ~]#cd snap1

	[root@ip-10-1-1-30 snap1~]# vim testfile1
		make some changes in the file and save it.

	[root@ip-10-1-1-30 snap1 ~]# cp testfile1 testfile2
				    cp testfile1 testfile3
				    cp testfile1 testfile4
				    cp testfile1 testfile5

5. Create a snapshot
	Volumes
	     create a snapshot of root volume 8gb
		name="OS-snap1"
                     -select the 8GB volume -actions-create snapshot
	        -it creates a snapshot in 'SnapShot'

    -For Snapshot we can't attach the root volume to it, when we are launching the new EC2 instance
(Note: If we accidentally delete the EC2 machine, with this Snapshot can we take the backup?)
		
		
	-Create image using snapshot
	    select snapshot - create image
	
	-It creates an image in AMI
	  to launch the machine using the image
	   select the image - launch

The other way also take the snapshot and create instance 

Instances
1. select the EC2-Machines - image  -create image
	imagename =MyImageusingInstance
	select checkbox 'NoReboot'

2. Now, check in AMI, image created.

3. Snapshots
	Check in snapshots also
	 individual volumes snapshot will be created.

(Note: Earlier, there an automated lambda script is used to run here to take the snapshots of your EC2 instances between 9-10pm, which is scheduled)

4. Instances.

	Now, terminate the EC2 Instance.
	
	Launch the machine using the image
	
	AMI
	    -select image ---> action - launch

	(this is image level backup of your instance)
	EC2Instance will be launched now using this image.

5.Connect your EC2 instance through SSH with new publicDNS(ipv4)
	[root@ip-10-1-1-30 ~]#lsblk

	[root@ip-10-1-1-30 ~]#ls /2gbdrive
	
	Need to mount the volume then only we can see the data in the(2gb)drive.which create before 
                 terminating the instance.
	Mount the volume
	[root@ip-10-1-1-30 ~]#mount /dev/xvdb1 /2gbdrive/
	[root@ip-10-1-1-30 ~]#mount /dev/xvdc1 /4gbdrive/


	[root@ip-10-1-1-30 /]# cd /2gbdrive/
	[root@ip-10-1-1-30 2gbdrive]# ls
	lost+found  snap1
	[root@ip-10-1-1-30 2gbdrive]# cd snap1
	[root@ip-10-1-1-30 snap1]# ls



Note: We can share our snapshots to other VPCs in other availablility zones
	
	AMI
		select image --> copy AMI-->select availabilityzones






InterviewQuestions:
===========

How Many EC2 Instances can we use in a VPC?

Solution:
	 Initially you are limited to launch 20 EC2 Instances at one time. Maximum VPC  size is 65,536 instances. 

Can we use  of default EBS Snapshots?
	Solution: Yes, we can provided if it is located in the same region where your VPC is present.
